Hi there ! Thanks for reviewing my work. ðŸ‘‹
Here are some infos concerning this project : 
I am starting my journey as a front end dev and web designer and created this website to train as well as demonstrate some of my skills.

The design was inspired by windows 95 and the 90s in general. I also wanted to add a girly feel to it mixed with retro vibes. 
To create the windows style I used https://jdan.github.io/98.css/ which is a wonderful ressurce for anything windows 95 css wise.

I decided to not include frameworks as I wanted to train using only css.

To make it interactive I started using vanilla Java Script but soon realized it was not the most effective way to go about it especially when I decided to implement 
the pop up windows. Using Jquery seemed the best way to do it. That's why you'll find a mix of vanilla and jquery.

âœ¨ I hope you'll enjoy my work !
